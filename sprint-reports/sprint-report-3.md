# Sprint 3 Report 
Video Link:
## What's New (User Facing)
* **Updated Dashboard:**  
  The student dashboard now displays available rooms and the user is then able to request to book a room. Notifications are also displayed to the user.
* **Repair Requests:**  
  Students can submit repair requests to admins. Students can choose from a variety of issues and levels of urgency in their report.
* **Updated Admin Features:**  
  The admins now have the ability to manage room requests, manage repair requests, and view the availability statuses of the rooms.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 3, our focus was primarily on implementing the remainder of our frontend features. We achieved this by:
* **Admin Dashboard Enhancement:**  
  Improved the admin dashboard, making it easier to manage room assignments.
* **Student Dashboard Enhancement:**
  The student dashboard has been updated to retrieve all available listings from the database and display them to the user.
* **Room Booking Implementation:**  
  Admins can view and approve room booking requests made by students. This is accompanied by a notification.
* **Repair Request Implementation:**  
  Students have the ability to report maintenance problems to admins. Admins can then track the status of the report.
